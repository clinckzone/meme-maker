- Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```js
npm run build
```

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Note

Use node version 16 to run it locally because some packages are not compatible with the latest node version. Here's how you can use older node version:

```js
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```
